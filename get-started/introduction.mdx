## What is it?

BuildProof is on a mission to bring together the best projects and devs in Web3. Part hackathon, part show-and-tell, part social network, BuildProof will be a platform for protocols to engage directly with developers and for devs to show off their work, earn prizes, compete with their peers to establish meaningful, transportable reputation.

## Why is it?

Thereâ€™s a [problem](https://app.t2.world/article/cluikmstn3773021zmcf56vcqn1) with the way Web3 hackathons are currently run. Sponsors pay huge fees to middlemen for access to devs. Devs spend multiple sleepless days (and sometimes weeks) building demos and prototypes with the hopes of earning rewards and catching the attention of sponsor projects. After, the work and reputation earned over these events is largely abandoned and much of the potential of these â€˜single serving communitiesâ€™ disappears into the ether, only to start again with the next event.

BuildProof is building a persistent, engaged and active community of cross platform Web3 devs. By combining an ongoing, open source hackathon model any protocol can leverage (powered by JokeRace) with an onchain, transportable reputation system (powered by Base EAS) and a platform for devs and protocols to engage meaningfully and persistently, we aim to build the best general purpose community for devs in Web3. 


## Whatâ€™s next?

These are the earliest of days and we want to start off the right way. The plan from **October - December 2024** is:

- Grow the Telegram and Discord communities and gather the best devs in the space.
- Issue our baseline reputation to OG members which will act as the â€˜Golden Ticketâ€™ to upcoming hackathons.
- Connect with protocols and projects that would be interested in working with us for our [devGames 2025](development) kickoff event in January.

If weâ€™ve done our job well things will start to get spicy in January! ðŸ”¥
