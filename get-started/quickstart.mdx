## Participate

BuildProof is a community first experiment in community building and weâ€™re learning as we go. Feedback and advice on how you would want to see this grow would be greatly appreciated. A few things we have talked about:

- A BuildProof podcast featuring new applications and the devs building them.
- Discord based â€˜show-and-tellâ€™ sessions for devs to present their projects to their peers for feedback and advice.
- Mentorship programs for new devs to get guidance from more experienced peers.

Reach out in Telegram or Discord if you have any ideas! ðŸ’¡

## Becoming a verified dev

While anyone can join the BuildProof community, to participate in some events and hackathons it may be necessary to hold the â€˜verified devâ€™ status. This represents the â€˜baselineâ€™ reputation in the BuildProof community. While the criteria to qualify for this status will evolve over time, at the outset, weâ€™ll be automatically verifying the following groups by leveraging:
