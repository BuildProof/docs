## About devGames 2025

Sponsor protocols will  judge and award submissions from devs across the entire blockchain ecosystem. Participating devs will have a chance to showcase their work to multiple projects & protocols and compete for prizes and glory all while building persistent reputation, connections and value for the work they’re doing.

## How it Works

> *Note: These are the broad strokes of how we are currently thinking about this, more details are forthcoming and some specifics may be changed or updated based on community/sponsor feedback.*

- devGames is divided into 10 x 2 week rounds with a final 4 week Championship round.
- Each round, the feature sponsor will issue a hackathon challenge on JokeRace, along with criteria and prizes.
- Verified devs will build & submit their projects. [See: [How to become a verified dev](/get-started/quickstart#becoming-a-verified-dev)]
- Each sponsor will put forward a judge to sit on the evaluation panel.
- The evaluation panel will judge submissions for each 2 week cycle.
- Winners will receive prizes, BuildProof reputation attestations and entry into the final Championship round.
- The final ‘Championship Round’ will run for the final 4 weeks
- Winners from previous rounds will compete in an open, cross-chain 4 week hackathon for the Grand Prize.
- Projects can be built on any participating partner chain.
- The final judging phase will be entirely community based.
